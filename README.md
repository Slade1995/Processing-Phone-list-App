# Processing-Phone-list-App
Feel free to add more similar data to the txt file :)

It is a very basic app but i thought it was quite cool how it all worked.
This java app uses a txt file to read through the data and displays the information based on the method names. i will list the methods and what they do below:

 readData() reads the data file content and populates the list of SmartPhone instances.
 
 getCheapest() calculates and returns the SmartPhone instance that has the lowest price in the list.
 
 countPhones() counts the number of SmartPhone instances with screen size between 5 â€“ 7 inches 
 
 randomPhoneList() that divides the phone instance list into three random lists.
 
 this is a sample of the output for my program:
